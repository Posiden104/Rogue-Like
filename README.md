Rogue-Like
==========

My first attempt at a RogueLike game

Added a map package with Map, Tile, and TileSet classes.
* [X] ~~They don't do anything right now because I'm met with a initialization error when trying to create the TileSets~~
* [X] Fixed the initialization error, rooms now render correctly (with proper set up)

**TODO**:

* [ ] Map Generator
	* [X] ~~fix the room generator~~
	* [X] add support for rectangular rooms
	* [ ] create method to load room to a specific location on map
	* [ ] create hall generator
	* [ ] create map generator
