Rogue-Like
==========

My first attempt at a RogueLike game
 
 -Added a map package with Map, Tile, and TileSet classes.
	- [x]~~They don't do anything right now because I'm met with a initialization error when trying to create the TileSets~~
 	- [x] Fixed the initialization error, rooms now render correctly (with proper set up)
 	
 TODO:
 	- [] Map Generator
 		- [] fix the room generator
 		- [] create hall generator
 		- [] create map generator
